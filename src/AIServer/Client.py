DEFAULT_PROMPT: Template = Template(r"""<|user|>\nYou are the world's best creative writer assigned to work on the popular game called RimWorld.\n\nA Rimworld is a planet lacking a strong central government and has a sparse population. These places tend to hover around the industrial level of technology or lower. Because theyâ€™re not homogenized by a central government, they tend to see a lot of interaction between people of different technology levels, as travelers crash-land or ancient communities stumble out of their cryptosleep vaults. These planets are often at the rim of known space, hence the name.\n\nYour task is to come up with descriptions for items found in-game. There are millions of possible items, so your work is cut out for you. I'll give you the information I have in XML, and you create a backstory that fits it! Aim for a five sentence description surrounded in quotes. Here you go:\n\n<saveable Class="Building_Art">\n  <id>SculptureGrand15070</id>\n  <pos>(60,0,66)</pos>\n  <map>0</map>\n  <health>195</health>\n  <stuff>WoodLog</stuff>\n  <faction>Faction_14</faction>\n  <questTags IsNull="True" />\n  <spawnedTick>59</spawnedTick>\n  <quality>Masterwork</quality>\n  <sourcePrecept>null</sourcePrecept>\n  <everSeenByPlayer>True</everSeenByPlayer>\n  <tile>0</tile>\n  <art>Son</art>\n  <seed>533422075</seed>\n  <taleRef>null</taleRef>\n</saveable>\n\nOriginal Description: "This sculpture bears a portrayal of a thresher suspended in the air surrounded by devils.
