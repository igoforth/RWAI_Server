"\n"
"**Example Output:**\n"
"\"'Why did you paint the moon red?' whispered the wind through the "
"ancient pines. No one knew if the question was meant for them, but in the"
" clearing, a solitary sculpture of a hand reaching upwards seemed to "
"respond. Carved from obsidian, 'The Crimson Touch' stood, fingers forever"
